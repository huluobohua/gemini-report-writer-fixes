# Product Requirements Document: Gemini Report Writer System Fixes

## Project Overview
Fix critical deficiencies in the Gemini Report Writer system that currently generates irrelevant, incoherent reports due to systemic flaws in source retrieval, content generation, and quality control.

## Problem Statement
The current system produces fundamentally broken reports where:
- Sources retrieved are completely unrelated to the requested topic
- Content is generated from irrelevant sources leading to nonsensical reports
- Citation system is broken with meaningless references
- No quality validation exists throughout the pipeline

## Goals and Objectives
1. Fix source retrieval to return topic-relevant sources
2. Implement content quality validation throughout the pipeline
3. Create proper citation and reference systems
4. Ensure generated reports are coherent and on-topic
5. Add comprehensive quality gates to prevent broken output

## Success Criteria
- Generated reports contain only content relevant to the requested topic
- All sources cited are actually related to the topic
- Citations are properly formatted and meaningful
- Research sections contain substantive, accurate content
- System rejects generation when insufficient relevant sources exist

## Technical Requirements

### Phase 1: Fix Source Retrieval (Critical)
- Implement smart query generation for search APIs
- Add topic relevance validation before processing sources
- Replace primitive keyword matching with LLM-based validation
- Create focused query strategies for different topic types

### Phase 2: Fix Research Workflow (Critical)
- Implement topic-focused research methodology
- Add research quality gates to reject irrelevant content
- Skip sections when no relevant sources exist
- Validate research coherence before inclusion

### Phase 3: Improve Content Generation (High Priority)
- Fix citation system to use valid source data
- Implement content quality control in writing
- Add coherence validation for generated content
- Focus on quality over quantity in output

### Phase 4: System-Wide Quality Assurance (Medium Priority)
- Create validation pipeline for all content
- Add topic coherence scoring
- Implement source usage validation
- Add quality gates throughout workflow

### Phase 5: Workflow Optimization (Medium Priority)
- Optimize outline generation for focused content
- Add validation nodes to workflow graph
- Implement conditional quality checks
- Streamline section-by-section processing

### Phase 6: Performance Improvements (Medium Priority)
- Implement smart caching based on topic similarity
- Optimize query generation algorithms
- Add source deduplication logic
- Improve error handling and recovery

### Phase 7: Final Integration and Testing (Low Priority)
- Integration testing of all components
- End-to-end validation testing
- Performance optimization
- Documentation and cleanup

## Constraints and Assumptions
- Must maintain compatibility with existing LangGraph workflow
- Should preserve multi-agent architecture
- Must work with existing Gemini and Tavily APIs
- Changes should be incremental and reviewable

## Timeline
Each phase should be completed as a separate PR with full review cycle:
1. Create implementation
2. Push to remote branch
3. Run /reviewwithgemini for validation
4. Iterate until approval
5. Merge and proceed to next phase

Estimated timeline: 1-2 weeks for complete implementation with review cycles.
