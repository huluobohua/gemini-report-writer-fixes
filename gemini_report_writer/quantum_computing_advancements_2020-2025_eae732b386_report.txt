## *   **Technical Progress:** Focus on the NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era, qubit count scaling, coherence times, and early error correction efforts.

**Technical Progress**

The current landscape of quantum computing is characterized by the **NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum)** era, a phase defined by devices possessing a limited quantity of qubits that are susceptible to noise, thereby impeding the execution of highly complex computations (n.d.). Notwithstanding these inherent limitations, substantial advancements are being achieved across several critical domains, including the scaling of qubit counts, improvements in coherence times, and the nascent stages of error correction initiatives. In terms of qubit count scaling, vendors have demonstrated considerable progress, with IBM, for example, achieving 127 qubits in 2021, escalating to 433 qubits in 2022, and subsequently surpassing the 1,000-qubit threshold in late 2023 (SpinQ, n.d.). IBM's "Condor" processor, unveiled in December 2023, notably featured 1,121 superconducting qubits, marking the first superconducting qubit quantum processor to exceed the 1,000-qubit milestone, building upon their prior development of the 127-qubit "Eagle" processor [Source 7, Source 10]. IBM's strategic roadmap further outlines a target of a 4,000-qubit system by 2025, a goal potentially attainable through the implementation of a modular architecture (No Author Specified, n.d.). Consequently, the industry's focus is progressively shifting from the mere aggregation of physical qubits towards the development of **logical qubits**, which are designed to mitigate the inherent limitations imposed by noise and restricted runtimes [Source 5, Source 8]. This endeavor involves both the enhancement of physical qubit quality and the creation of more efficacious error-correction codes (SpinQ, n.d.). In 2023, a significant demonstration saw researchers at QuEra and Harvard University unveil a 48-logical-qubit computer (SpinQ, n.d.). Moreover, a considerable number of companies, including IBM Quantum, Google, Microsoft, Diraq, IonQ, IQM, Pasqal, PsiQuantum, Quantinuum, Quandela, and Xanadu, have articulated clear roadmaps for the development of logical qubits (SpinQ, n.d.). Regarding coherence times and error correction efforts, quantum systems are acutely vulnerable to noise and decoherence, rendering effective Quantum Error Correction (QEC) an indispensable prerequisite for the realization of scalable and dependable quantum computing (No Author Specified, n.d.). In 2024, a pivotal recalibration of focus occurred, moving from the mere enumeration of physical qubits to the active implementation and refinement of logical qubits (No Author Specified, n.d.). Google, in August 2024, announced a notable demonstration of a quantum memory exhibiting below-threshold error rates and a doubling of coherence lifetimes compared to its physical counterparts (SpinQ, n.d.). Google also disclosed a novel methodology for extending the duration of errors (SpinQ, n.d.). Nevertheless, the achievement of target logical error rates, such as one in a million, remains a critical impediment to the practical deployment of quantum applications (No Author Specified, n.d.). The field continues to confront persistent challenges related to reliability and scaling (No Author Specified, n.d.). The NISQ era is currently grappling with ongoing obstacles, including the imperative to enhance qubit performance, diminish noise levels, and develop more sophisticated error correction methodologies (n.d.). The progress anticipated within this decade is projected to facilitate the transition from the NISQ era towards fully error-corrected systems populated by millions of qubits (n.d.). While research groups are making commendable strides in both quantum hardware and error correction, the realization of commercial readiness continues to present a significant challenge (No Author Specified, n.d.). In summary, the quantum computing field is firmly entrenched in the NISQ era, characterized by a burgeoning number of physical qubits but still contending with substantial noise and coherence limitations (n.d.). Key advancements include IBM's successful development of processors exceeding 1,000 physical qubits [Source 5, Source 7, Source 10] and their ambitious roadmap targeting 4,000 qubits by 2025 (No Author Specified, n.d.). A pronounced trend is the strategic pivot towards **logical qubits** as a means to surmount the inherent constraints of physical qubits, with numerous companies actively formulating roadmaps for their development [Source 3, Source 5, Source 8]. Google's demonstrated improvements in quantum memory coherence times and error rates are particularly noteworthy [Source 3, Source 5]. Despite these significant advancements, achieving low logical error rates and ensuring overall system reliability remain critical challenges [Source 6, Source 8]. The progress currently being made is fundamentally laying the groundwork for the emergence of future, more robust quantum systems (n.d.).

Collectively, the research underscores the growing necessity for advanced computational tools and simulation-based methodologies to address challenges in energy, healthcare, and business operations, thereby highlighting the prospective role of quantum computing in unlocking novel capabilities and driving innovation across these critical application areas.

## *   **Economic Projections:** Early forecasts of market size and potential economic impact, often speculative.

Early economic projections for new technologies, particularly within the telecommunications sector, frequently involve substantial investment and the potential for significant market disruption and growth. The anticipated deployment cost for 5G in the United Kingdom, for instance, is estimated to fall between £30 billion and £50 billion, a considerable escalation from the current annual capital expenditure of mobile network operators (MNOs), which stands at £2.5 billion (n.d.). This substantial financial outlay is identified as a primary impediment to the physical infrastructure build-out of 5G networks (n.d.). Nevertheless, strategies aimed at mitigating these deployment costs are under active consideration, with the utilization of existing public infrastructure, such as streetlights and telephone poles, offering the potential for cost reductions ranging from approximately 40% to 60% (n.d.). The dense device connectivity anticipated with 5G is also projected to lead to a significant increase in data availability, encompassing both traditional and non-traditional data streams. This heightened data availability is expected to foster extensive data harvesting initiatives, presenting a significant business opportunity for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large social networks alike. Consequently, the development of a 5G data exchange ecosystem, where data transactions are considered high-value business commodities, is a foreseen outcome (n.d.). The commodification of data, coupled with potentially lower-cost physical infrastructure and spectrum, is predicted to instigate considerable disruption within the existing telecommunications business ecosystem, impacting established MNOs and TowerCos and potentially facilitating the emergence of new infrastructure and spectrum stakeholders (n.d.). Beyond telecommunications, digitalization and emerging technologies are fundamentally reshaping the development and delivery of financial services. This transformation empowers non-financial institutions, including Fintechs, Big Tech, and telecommunications companies (Telcos), to become active participants in the financial industry. Such a shift has the potential to enhance financial inclusion, reduce transaction costs, and encourage traditional banks to adopt novel business models that leverage Big Data and advanced data analytics (SpinQ, n.d.). The broader economic implications of emerging technologies are also underscored by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)'s commitment to promoting policies that foster sustainable economic growth, employment, improved living standards, and financial stability, thereby contributing to the advancement of the global economy (n.d.). The concept of "digital time" and its pervasive influence on media infrastructures and social relations is also a subject of ongoing academic inquiry, indicating a wider recognition of how technological advancements shape temporal patterns [Source 2, Source 4].

The emergence of initial government-led quantum initiatives signifies a global recognition of the strategic importance of quantum technologies, driving focused efforts to foster research, development, and eventual commercialization. In the United States, the National Quantum Initiative Act (NQIA), signed into law in 2018 (n.d.), serves as a cornerstone of its quantum strategy, aiming to significantly increase funding for quantum technology (n.d.). This has translated into substantial reported budgets for Quantum Information Science (QIS) R&D, with $450 million allocated for fiscal year 2019 and $672 million for fiscal year 2020 (No Author Specified, n.d.). The National Quantum Initiative (NQI) Program is now in its fifth annual report, detailing investments as mandated by the NQI Act (n.d.). Further bolstering this commitment, lawmakers and industry leaders advocate for the reauthorization of the National Quantum Initiative, with a proposed National Quantum Initiative Reauthorization Act that would authorize $2.7 billion in federal funding over the next five years to accelerate quantum research and development at federal science agencies (n.d.). Beyond research and development, the U.S. government is also addressing the national security implications of quantum computing through initiatives such as National Security Memorandum 10 (2022), which mandates the upgrade of communication systems to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) by 2035, acknowledging the potential risk quantum computers pose to U.S. government communications (n.d.). The U.S. leadership in quantum sciences and its efforts to provide grants for research and education are also highlighted (No Author Specified, n.d.). The European Union, through the European Commission, has put forward a strategy with the ambitious objective of becoming a global leader in quantum technology by 2030 (No Author Specified, n.d.). This strategy includes plans to expand the network of Quantum Competence Clusters across the EU and establish the European quantum skills academy in 2026 (No Author Specified, n.d.). Complementing these major initiatives, Australia is investing an additional AU$101.2 million over the next five years from its $1 billion critical technology fund to support a new national quantum strategy (n.d.). New Zealand is providing up to NZ$12 million in government funding over the next five years to a program developed by Te Whai Ao – Dodd-Walls Centre for Photonic and Quantum Technologies, leveraging its expertise in quantum technology research (n.d.).

## *   **Ethical and Societal Implications:** Discussions on quantum supremacy, dual-use technology, and post-quantum cryptography.

The rapid evolution of quantum computing introduces a complex web of ethical and societal considerations, primarily revolving around the achievement of quantum supremacy, the inherent dual-use nature of the technology, and the critical imperative for post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Quantum supremacy, a benchmark signifying a quantum processor's ability to outperform classical computers on a specific, often contrived, task, has been demonstrated by entities such as Google with its Willow quantum chip (n.d.). However, it is crucial to note that quantum computing platforms have not yet achieved a broader quantum advantage applicable to real-world problems (No Author Specified, n.d.). The development of quantum computing is inherently a dual-use technology, possessing the potential for both transformative benefits and significant ethical challenges, thus demanding the establishment of robust frameworks for its secure and equitable utilization (SpinQ, n.d.). The broad engagement of diverse sectors, including governmental bodies, nascent startups, and established tech industry leaders, in advancing this field suggests a proactive approach to addressing anticipated challenges (SpinQ, n.d.). A paramount societal concern stems from the existential threat that large-scale quantum computers, when realized, pose to the integrity of critical information infrastructure and existing cryptographic protocols, a phenomenon often termed "Y2Q," representing the anticipated moment when quantum computers will be capable of breaking current state-of-the-art asymmetric cryptography [Source 3, Source 4, Source 5]. In direct response to this looming threat, substantial efforts are dedicated to the development and deployment of post-quantum cryptography [Source 3, Source 5]. The United States, through initiatives like the White House and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), has actively engaged officials and industry partners in discussions aimed at fortifying critical information infrastructure against this impending risk (SpinQ, n.d.). NIST has consequently announced the standardization of new Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms, a suite of encryption methods engineered to resist quantum computer attacks (SpinQ, n.d.). Reflecting this commitment, NIST released the inaugural standardized PQC algorithms in August 2024, thereby enabling organizations to integrate quantum-safe encryption alongside conventional methods (No Author Specified, n.d.). This strategic focus on advancing quantum security is further evidenced by the pivotal role played by national laboratories, such as NIST, in driving progress within the United States (No Author Specified, n.d.). The U.S. Administration’s policy on quantum computing, as articulated in National Security Memorandum 10 signed in May 2022, underscores a strategic imperative to both foster the technology's advancement and prioritize the mitigation of risks to existing encryption (SpinQ, n.d.). While quantum computing deals reached a record high in 2023, a projected slowdown, or "quantum investment winter," potentially driven by shifting investor attention towards Generative AI, might influence the timeline for widespread adoption and the eventual materialization of the "Y2Q" threat (No Author Specified, n.d.). Consequently, the dual-use nature of quantum computing necessitates careful ethical deliberation and the proactive establishment of frameworks to ensure its secure and equitable application (SpinQ, n.d.).

## *   **2.2. Major Debates and Controversies:**

The discourse surrounding quantum computing is marked by several significant debates and controversies, primarily concerning the demonstration of true quantum advantage, the efficacy and implementation of quantum error correction (QEC), and the practical challenges of scaling quantum systems. A central point of contention is the definitive establishment of "quantum advantage," wherein quantum computers demonstrably outperform classical counterparts on computationally intractable problems. While advancements such as Google's Willow quantum chip represent progress [Source 5, Source 8], the "State of Quantum Computing 2024" report by Forrester suggests that current quantum platforms have yet to conclusively achieve this advantage (SpinQ, n.d.). This perceived shortfall is a contributing factor to a potential "quantum investment winter," as investor focus shifts towards other emerging technologies like Generative AI, potentially impeding mainstream adoption and the anticipated timeline for "Y2Q"—the point at which quantum computers could compromise current cryptographic standards (SpinQ, n.d.).

Quantum error correction (QEC) is widely recognized as a pivotal element for the maturation of quantum computing (No Author Specified, n.d.).

Furthermore, the achievement of high fidelity for two-qubit gates, reaching 99.9% in trapped ion systems, signals a progression towards fault tolerance (No Author Specified, n.d.). Quantum processors with over 100 qubits are presently available and undergoing evaluation (No Author Specified, n.d.). The commercial viability of quantum technology is also being demonstrated, with predictions of substantial growth in commercial applications (SpinQ, n.d.). For instance, D-Wave's Advantage system, launched in 2020, features over 5,000 qubits and advanced connectivity suitable for intricate optimization problems, and customer successes, such as an 80% reduction in scheduling efforts in 2024, have been reported [Source 3, Source 5]. A notable shift from development to deployment is being observed, driven primarily by leading technology companies (No Author Specified, n.d.). The future trajectory of quantum processors is anticipated to be built upon logical qubits, enabling them to address increasingly practical tasks (No Author Specified, n.d.). The attainment of a genuine logical qubit, capable of outperforming its physical counterparts and serving as a foundational element for scalable systems, was achieved in 2024 (No Author Specified, n.d.).

Conversely, arguments for a "Quantum Winter" or concerns about overhype are rooted in the current limitations and projected timelines. Despite the noted technological progress, quantum computing platforms have yet to demonstrate a definitive quantum advantage (n.d.). Investor attention has demonstrably shifted towards the burgeoning field of Generative AI, leading to expectations of a "quantum investment winter," which could consequently delay mainstream adoption and the eventual capability of quantum computers to compromise current asymmetric cryptography (Y2Q) (n.d.). Some industry leaders, such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have posited that quantum computing is still 15 to 30 years away from achieving true utility, indicating that while quantum computing is gaining prominence and becoming more practical, widespread commercial adoption remains distant (n.d.). Acknowledged "hype problem" exists within the quantum computing sector, wherein the reality of extensive commercial deployment is perceived as being considerably further off than often portrayed [Source 7, Source 9]. The inherent complexity of constructing full-scale quantum computers necessitates concurrent advancements across multiple critical domains, including qubit scaling, fidelity enhancement, robust error correction mechanisms, and the development of sophisticated quantum software and algorithms (No Author Specified, n.d.). Key statistics highlight the current state: quantum chips with over 100 qubits are available (No Author Specified, n.d.), D-Wave's Advantage system possesses over 5,000 qubits (SpinQ, n.d.), and Quantinuum's System Model H1 was upgraded to 20 fully connected qubits in June 2022, while QCI introduced an 8-qubit processor in November 2024 (SpinQ, n.d.). Patent application trends reveal China and the United States as leading nations, with China dominating quantum computing patents and the US leading in quantum communication patents in 2024 (No Author Specified, n.d.).

D-Wave's CEO Dr. Alan Baratz asserted in January 2025 that their technology is already delivering value (SpinQ, n.d.). In summary, the "Quantum Winter" versus "Quantum Spring" debate encapsulates a field characterized by significant technological strides, especially in error correction and qubit fidelity [Source 4, Source 6, Source 8], with companies reporting customer successes and a noticeable shift towards deployment [Source 3, Source 4]. Nevertheless, the consensus remains that practical quantum advantage is yet to be definitively proven (n.d.). Concerns regarding overhype are prevalent, and projections from some industry figures suggest longer timelines for widespread commercial utility, potentially spanning 15-30 years [Source 7, Source 9]. The diversion of investment towards AI is also anticipated to contribute to a slowdown in quantum computing funding, potentially ushering in a "quantum investment winter" (n.d.). Despite these prevailing challenges, the foundational progress has been substantial, and 2025 is expected to witness further breakthroughs across various quantum computing sub-fields (No Author Specified, n.d.). The robust debate within the quantum computing community underscores the profound implications and considerable excitement surrounding the ongoing pursuit of scalable quantum computing (No Author Specified, n.d.).

## *   **Hardware Modality Race:** Which qubit technology (superconducting, trapped ion, photonic, neutral atom, topological) holds the most promise for scalability and fault tolerance.

The pursuit of scalable and fault-tolerant quantum computing is a multi-faceted endeavor, with several qubit technologies vying for prominence, each possessing unique strengths and developmental trajectories. Superconducting and trapped-ion qubits currently represent the most mature modalities, having achieved significant commercialization and demonstrating aggressive roadmaps towards fault tolerance [Source 2, Source 5]. Superconducting qubits are particularly adept at executing rapid quantum logic gates, making them well-suited for near-term applications, and have attracted the highest levels of quantum computing investment [Source 1, Source 4]. Companies like IBM are actively scaling their superconducting qubit processors and investing heavily in error-correction software, with an ambitious target of delivering a fully fault-tolerant quantum computer by 2029, aiming for approximately 200 logical qubits (SpinQ, n.d.). Rigetti Computing also employs superconducting tunable transmon qubits in its systems (n.d.). Trapped-ion qubits, on the other hand, excel in error correction and precision, and are recognized for their high fidelity and all-to-all connectivity, which experts predict will lead in both fidelity and scalability [Source 2, Source 3]. Honeywell, now Quantinuum, utilizes trapped-ion technology, focusing on scalable and highly accurate systems, and has notably demonstrated a fully error-corrected logical qubit [Source 2, Source 5]. Microsoft's collaboration with Quantinuum has further underscored the reliability of logical qubits derived from the inherent high fidelities and connectivity of trapped ion systems (No Author Specified, n.d.). IonQ is another leading entity in this domain, showcasing high-fidelity operations [Source 2, Source 3]. Oxford Ionics also contributes to the advancement of trapped-ion technologies (n.d.). Neutral atom qubits are emerging as strong contenders, demonstrating significant potential for scalability and rapid development, particularly in the realm of reprogrammable quantum simulations [Source 1, Source 2]. QuEra Computing is a notable player in this rapidly advancing modality [Source 4, Source 10]. Photonic qubits offer distinct advantages in quantum communication and are also receiving substantial funding, albeit less than superconducting technologies [Source 1, Source 4]. Xanadu is a company actively pursuing photonic quantum computing (n.d.). Topological qubits, while not yet realized, hold considerable promise for long-term robustness and scalability, representing a potential future breakthrough, though they remain in the early stages of research [Source 1, Source 2]. The overarching trend across all these modalities is an intensified industry focus on developing logical, or error-corrected qubits, which are indispensable for scaling quantum computers [Source 6, Source 9]. The entire quantum computing sector is aligning towards ambitious timelines, with many players aiming to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computing by the late 2020s or early 2030s (SpinQ, n.d.). Significant investments, bolstered by government support and strategic partnerships, are accelerating progress, with the transition from laboratory prototypes to commercial products well underway, fostering intense competition between various companies and technologies [Source 4, Source 6]. The industry's convergence on aggressive timelines and the achievement of groundbreaking milestones are collectively reshaping the quantum computing landscape towards the realization of scalable logical qubits (No Author Specified, n.d.).

## *   **Role of Government vs. Private Sector:** The optimal balance of public funding, private investment, and industry-led innovation.

The optimal balance between government and private sector involvement in fostering scientific and technological progress is a complex interplay of distinct yet complementary roles. Governments are instrumental in providing public funding for research and development (R&D), setting strategic direction, and addressing broad societal challenges. For instance, the Austrian federal government's funding of research, technology, and innovation (RTI) as outlined in their 2022 report exemplifies this governmental role in supporting national RTI strategies and analyzing performance (SpinQ, n.d.). Furthermore, governments often lead strategic initiatives to advance specific technological fields, as demonstrated by the "National Quantum Initiative," which involves significant budget allocation, international cooperation, national security considerations, and talent development in quantum information science (n.d.). The government's role extends to steering energy transitions, as discussed in the context of affordable and clean energy, where policy instruments and scientifically sound visions are crucial for a just energy system (No Author Specified, n.d.). Conversely, the private sector serves as a significant driver of innovation, commercialization, and market diffusion of emerging technologies. The importance of an interdisciplinary dialogue between academic and industrial scientists, entrepreneurs, and managers is highlighted as a catalyst for breakthrough ideas, underscoring the private sector's vital role in the practical application and development of new technologies (n.d.). Many emerging technologies are commercially available, a testament to private sector investment and development (No Author Specified, n.d.). Historically, the private sector has also been a proactive force in educational and knowledge development, as seen in Kuwait where merchant class representatives initiated the development of a formal education system and later advocated for scientific research development (No Author Specified, n.d.). The effectiveness of technological progress is often amplified through strong dialogue and collaboration between these entities. International assessments of R&D activities, such as those concerning Simulation-Based Engineering and Science (SBE&S), examine funding schemes and collaborative interactions among universities, national laboratories, and corporate research centers, indicating that the interplay between public institutions and private companies is a critical area of focus and development (No Author Specified, n.d.). While specific quantitative measures for the "optimal balance" are not explicitly detailed across the provided sources, the overarching consensus points to a symbiotic relationship where governments provide foundational support and strategic vision, and the private sector drives innovation and market adoption, with robust collaboration being key to maximizing R&D impact [Source 1, Source 4, Source 7, Source 8, Source 10].

## *   **Geopolitical Implications:** The "quantum race" and its potential impact on global power dynamics and technological sovereignty.

The development of quantum technologies has emerged as a pivotal factor in contemporary global power dynamics, precipitating a pronounced "quantum race" with profound implications for technological sovereignty [Source 2, Source 4, Source 9]. This escalating competition, primarily between the United States and China, is characterized by substantial investment and significant policy realignments as nations vie for dominance in this transformative field (n.d.). As of 2023, China has demonstrably narrowed the gap with the United States, positioning itself as a formidable competitor, even standing "neck-and-neck" in specific quantum subfields (n.d.). This dynamic is further illustrated by the differing strategic emphases: China leads in quantum computing patent applications, while the U.S. holds a lead in quantum communication patents, suggesting divergent national priorities within the broader quantum landscape (No Author Specified, n.d.). The increasing recognition of advanced technological capacities, including quantum computing, microchips, artificial intelligence, and battery technology, as critical sovereign assets within the context of great power competition has consequently driven efforts to control the diffusion of quantum capabilities (n.d.). Global investment in quantum computing is substantial, with cumulative disclosed funding for companies engaged in quantum technology worldwide reaching $15 billion as of 2024 (No Author Specified, n.d.). This investment is further bolstered by governmental initiatives; for instance, the U.S. Department of Energy announced $65 million in funding for quantum computing projects in September 2024, building upon an approximate $4 billion allocated in the 2024 annual budget report for the National Quantum Initiative Program (No Author Specified, n.d.). The pace of quantum computing advancement has exceeded earlier projections, prompting critical security adaptations, such as NIST moving up its timeline for transitioning to quantum-resistant cryptography (n.d.). Recent technological milestones, such as IBM's Condor processor surpassing 1,000 qubits in late 2023, underscore the unprecedented acceleration in this domain (SpinQ, n.d.). This quantum race is unfolding against a backdrop of shifting global power structures, moving from a unipolar to a more multipolar world order, where competition for technological leadership is a defining characteristic (n.d.). The failure of early attempts to establish a global non-proliferation regime for quantum capabilities has compelled original "quantum powers" to accelerate the sharing of quantum advancements with their allies (n.d.). However, this trajectory raises significant concerns for the Global South, which, without equitable access to quantum resources, risks increased vulnerability of its security infrastructure due to the threat quantum computing poses to existing encryption, diminished economic competitiveness, and the erosion of technological sovereignty through dependence on other nations (n.d.). In response to these geopolitical realities, leading nations have implemented export controls and restrictions: the U.S. has enacted export bans and broader licensing requirements impacting quantum systems, while the EU imposes limitations through a dual-use framework restricting exports of systems exceeding 34 qubits (n.d.). China has also instituted its own restrictions, particularly on quantum encryption and ultra-low loss materials (n.d.). Beyond the geopolitical implications, quantum computing is poised to become a significant economic force, with projections suggesting a global market reaching $1.4 billion by 2025, and a substantial majority of companies (up to 75%) planning to invest in quantum computing over the next five years, signaling potential new job market opportunities (No Author Specified, n.d.).

Superconducting qubits represent a prominent modality in quantum computing, distinguished by their rapid gate speeds and high fidelity (SpinQ, n.d.). Nevertheless, the expansion of these systems to encompass a substantial number of qubits presents considerable challenges, particularly concerning the efficacy of error correction [Source 4, Source 8, Source 9]. A primary scaling hurdle is the resource intensity associated with achieving low logical error rates; for instance, attaining an error rate of 10⁻⁶ would necessitate a distance-27 logical qubit, which in turn requires 1,457 physical qubits (n.d.). Furthermore, as the number of physical qubits grows with the code distance, the complexity of real-time decoding escalates quadratically, posing a significant impediment to scalability (n.d.). Fundamental limitations, such as material defects, can also constrain the achievable error rates in superconducting qubits, even when employing advanced error correction techniques [Source 8, Source 10]. Despite these challenges, substantial progress is being made in error mitigation and correction for superconducting qubits. Notably, Google has demonstrated advancements in surpassing the Quantum Error Correction (QEC) threshold using surface codes on superconducting qubits, a critical achievement for proponents of this qubit technology (No Author Specified, n.d.).

In response to these challenges, various countries and international bodies are actively developing national quantum strategies and governance frameworks [Source 2, Source 5]. For example, the United Kingdom has initiated quantum hubs and established a national quantum computing center to accelerate advancements, while simultaneously developing a proportionate and phased regulatory framework aligned with its commitment to responsible innovation and strategic collaboration (n.d.). The global market for quantum computing was projected to reach $65 billion by 2025 (n.d.), with the quantum market valued at approximately $1 billion in 2024 and forecast to grow to $12 billion by 2032 (No Author Specified, n.d.). The EU has implemented export controls on systems exceeding 34 qubits [Source 3, Source 6], and the US has also introduced export bans and licensing requirements for quantum technology (No Author Specified, n.d.). The transition to quantum-safe cryptography is a critical and ongoing effort, recognized as a key trend for 2025 (No Author Specified, n.d.), though concerns persist regarding its pace and the need for improved stakeholder coordination (No Author Specified, n.d.). A notable concern also includes a lack of ethical guidelines and regulatory safeguards (SpinQ, n.d.), alongside calls for responsible innovation and transparent approaches to intellectual property (n.d.). In summation, the ethical and security considerations surrounding quantum technology are intricate and multifaceted. The dual-use nature of quantum computing mandates careful management through export controls. The impending threat to current cryptographic systems necessitates an accelerated transition to quantum-safe solutions. Moreover, responsible innovation, underpinned by robust ethical guidelines and comprehensive governance frameworks, is paramount to ensuring that the transformative potential of quantum computing is harnessed for societal benefit while effectively mitigating inherent risks.
